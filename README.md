# Birthday Challenge

mathbirthdays.com is a site that wants to help people celebrate their special "math birthdays." A
"math birthday" is a date that is 10^n days after the day they were born. On your first math
birthday you are 10 days old, and on your second you are 100 days old, and on your third you
are 1000 days old, which is almost 3 years old, etc.
The mathbirthdays.com site is very simple. There is a way to select your birth date, and the
page shows your next upcoming math birthday. For example, if your birth date was 3 days ago,
it would say "Your next math birthday is your 10-day-old birthday on X date," where X date is a
week from now. The site is a single html file with no assets. All css and javascript is inline or
hosted in publicly accessible locations elsewhere (like jquery or other frameworks).

## For the challenge

1. Design and implement the birth date selector that is easy and intuitive with minimal
unnecessary clicks, and works on large and small screens (responsive and touch friendly).
Please include a screenshot or photo of 3 different design ideas (wireframes) that you
considered.
2. Design and implement the javascript to calculate and display the next math birthday date
message below the date selector. Please remember, the site should be a single page
application, with a link to view it live hosted on something like jsfiddle or github.io or wherever,
and a link to the source code

### In this challenge, you will be judged on:

0. Accuracy in following the challenge instructions
1. Responsiveness of the design
2. Usability and aesthetics of the design
